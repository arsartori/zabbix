You need to install zabbix agent on hosts that you intend to monitor.After that copy these four powershell scripts and update zabbix agent conf file adding to userparameter key the following line :

UserParameter=apppool.discovery,powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\zabbix_agents_3.0.0.win\get_apppool.ps1"
UserParameter=apppool.state[*],powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\zabbix_agents_3.0.0.win\get_apppoolstate.ps1 "$1"
UserParameter=site.discovery,powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\zabbix_agents_3.0.0.win\get_sites.ps1"
UserParameter=site.state[*],powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\zabbix_agents_3.0.0.win\get_sitestate.ps1 "$1"
